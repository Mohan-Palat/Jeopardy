# Jeopardy

A browser based version of the classic television game show.  The application was written using the React Javascript library resulting in a single-page, dynamically updating solution.  Its data source is a third party API called jService (https://jservice.io/).

The current version supports one player and allows the user to choose between two game modes.  The first selects six random categories with five questions (i.e, clues) like the traditional game show.  The second mode allows users to select six categories from a predefined list.
